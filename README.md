# Robot-Motion-Planning-and-Control
This is a brief university repository for Robot Motion Planning and Control using RoboToolbox and Python 3.8.10:

### ðŸ”¬ Lab 1: Introduction to Robot Toolbox Tools

- Explore basic tools provided by **Robot Toolbox**  
- Load a manipulator model  
- Plan a joint-space trajectory  
- Solve the inverse dynamics problem  
- Visualize the motion of each robot link  

---

### ðŸ”§ Lab 2: Kinematics and Trajectory Analysis

- Load a manipulator model  
- Solve the **forward kinematics** for given joint configurations  
- Plan and execute a trajectory  
- Plot joint-level **position**, **velocity**, and **acceleration** graphs during the motion

---
### ðŸ§­ Lab 3: Path Planning with Potential Field Method

- Write a program to plan a path from an initial point to a final point while avoiding obstacles using the **Potential Field Method**
- Independently define the initial and final positions, as well as obstacle locations in the workspace
- Visualize the resulting path and obstacle avoidance behavior

---

### ðŸ¤– Lab 4: Trajectory Planning Through Multiple Points

- Write a program to generate a motion trajectory for a selected manipulator that passes through **four predefined points**
  - 4.1 Select a robot model  
  - 4.2 Solve the **forward** and **inverse kinematics**  
  - 4.3 Define four target points for the robot to pass through  
  - 4.4 Choose appropriate **time functions** for motion  
  - 4.5 Compute the function parameters for smooth trajectory planning  
- Visualize the final trajectory and robot motion
